ðŸš¨ URGENT: DATABASE RLS POLICY FIX NEEDED

The registration is failing because Supabase RLS policies are blocking user creation.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: bmtaqilpuszwoshtizmq
3. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Copy and paste this EXACT SQL and run it:

-- Fix RLS policies for user registration
BEGIN;

-- Drop all restrictive INSERT policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated user creation" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can insert users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow OAuth user creation" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow OAuth user upsert" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow user registration" ON public.users;

-- Create permissive policy for registration
CREATE POLICY "Allow user registration and OAuth creation" ON public.users
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
auth.uid() IS NULL
OR
(auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND auth.uid() = id)
OR
current_setting('role') = 'service_role'
);

COMMIT;

SELECT 'âœ… Registration RLS policy fixed!' as result;

5. Click "RUN" to execute the SQL
6. You should see "âœ… Registration RLS policy fixed!" message
7. Then try registration again

This will allow anonymous users to register while maintaining security.
