    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    token VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    used_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NULL
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE email_verification_tokens ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy for public access (required for Edge Function)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public token verification" ON email_verification_tokens
    FOR SELECT USING (true);
```
