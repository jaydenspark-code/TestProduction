# Braintree Payment Methods Configuration Guide

## Current Issues and Solutions

### 1. PayPal "Developer Error" Issue

The PayPal error you're seeing is likely due to one of these reasons:

**Possible Causes:**
- PayPal not enabled in your Braintree sandbox account
- Incorrect flow configuration (we changed from 'checkout' to 'vault')
- Missing PayPal app configuration in Braintree dashboard

**Solution Applied:**
- Changed PayPal flow to 'vault' for better compatibility
- Added proper error logging to see exact error details

### 2. Missing Payment Methods (Venmo, Google Pay, Apple Pay)

**Why they might not appear:**
- **Account Settings**: These need to be specifically enabled in your Braintree merchant account
- **Device/Browser Requirements**: Some only work on specific platforms
- **Sandbox Limitations**: Some features may be limited in sandbox mode

## Payment Methods Configuration

### Currently Enabled in Code:
1. ✅ **Credit/Debit Cards** - Always available
2. ✅ **PayPal** - Fixed configuration
3. ✅ **PayPal Credit** - Added
4. ✅ **Venmo** - Added (desktop enabled)
5. ✅ **Apple Pay** - Added (requires Safari/iOS)
6. ✅ **Google Pay** - Added (requires Chrome/Android)

### Braintree Account Requirements:

#### For PayPal:
1. Log into your Braintree sandbox dashboard
2. Go to Settings > Processing
3. Ensure PayPal is enabled
4. Check that your PayPal sandbox account is linked

#### For Venmo:
1. Must be enabled in Braintree dashboard
2. Only works in production with real Venmo accounts
3. In sandbox, may not always appear

#### For Apple Pay:
1. Requires Safari browser or iOS device
2. Must be enabled in Braintree dashboard
3. Requires SSL certificate (HTTPS)
4. Need to register your domain with Apple

#### For Google Pay:
1. Requires Chrome browser or Android device
2. Must be enabled in Braintree dashboard

4. Need Google Pay merchant ID

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Check Available Payment Methods:
- Use the diagnostics component in the payment test page
- Look at browser console for detailed logs
- Check what payment methods are actually enabled in your account

### 2. PayPal Testing:
- If still getting errors, try the Braintree test PayPal account:
  - Email: sb-buyer@example.com
  - Password: password123

### 3. Test Cards for Different Methods:
```
Visa: 4111 1111 1111 1111
Mastercard: 5555 5555 5555 4444
Amex: 3782 8224 6310 005
Discover: 6011 1111 1111 1117
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run Diagnostics**: Use the new diagnostics component to see what's enabled
2. **Check Braintree Dashboard**: Verify payment method settings
3. **Test on HTTPS**: Some payment methods require secure connection
4. **Review Console Logs**: Check for specific error messages

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:
1. Enable HTTPS/SSL
2. Register domain with Apple Pay (if using)
3. Set up Google Pay merchant account
4. Configure webhooks for payment notifications
5. Implement proper error handling and retry logic

## Common Sandbox Limitations

- Venmo may not work in sandbox
- Apple Pay requires real Apple ID in sandbox
- Google Pay may have limited functionality
- PayPal requires linked sandbox accounts

The enhanced configuration should show more payment methods if they're enabled in your account!
