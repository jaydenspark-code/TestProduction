## 🔄 **Progressive Reset Logic**

### **First 4 Tiers (Rookie → Steel)**

#### **Reset Attempts**:

- **Original Attempt**: Start from 0, aim for full target
- **Reset 1**: Start from **half target**, aim for full target
- **Reset 2**: Start from **half target**, aim for full target
- **After 2 failed resets**: **Demotion** to previous tier challenge

#### **Special Steel Rule**:

- **Original attempt**: 7 days
- **Reset attempts**: **10 days** (extended time for hardest tier)

#### **Examples**:

```
🥉 Rookie (50 target):  Resets start from 25
🥈 Bronze (100 target): Resets start from 50
🔩 Iron (200 target):   Resets start from 100
🛡️ Steel (400 target):  Resets start from 200 + 10 days
```

### **Advanced Tiers (Silver → Diamond)**

#### **Retry Attempts**:

- **Original Attempt**: Start from 0, aim for full target
- **Retry 1-3**: Start from **half of max reached** in failed attempt
- **After 3 failed retries**: **Demotion** to previous tier challenge

#### **Examples**:

```
Silver Agent reaches 800, fails:
- Retry 1-3: Start from 400 → 1,000

Gold Agent reaches 3,200, fails:
- Retry 1-3: Start from 1,600 → 5,000

Platinum Agent reaches 7,500, fails:
- Retry 1-3: Start from 3,750 → 10,000
```

## 📊 **Demotion Chain System**

### **Failure Consequences**:

```
Bronze fails 3 times    → Back to Rookie challenge
Iron fails 3 times      → Back to Bronze challenge
Steel fails 3 times     → Back to Iron challenge
Silver fails 4 times    → Back to Steel challenge
Gold fails 4 times      → Back to Silver challenge
Platinum fails 4 times  → Back to Gold challenge
Diamond fails 4 times   → Back to Platinum challenge
```

### **Clean Slate Policy**:

- No tracking of failure history
- Fresh start at demoted tier
- Maintains motivation and hope

## 🎯 **Hybrid Referral Counting**

### **First 4 Tiers: Direct Only**

- **Focus**: Personal recruitment skills
- **Count**: Direct referrals only
- **Goal**: Build direct selling ability

### **Advanced Tiers: Network Building**

- **Focus**: Leadership and mentoring
- **Count**: Direct + Level 1 indirect referrals
- **Goal**: Create viral growth networks

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema Updates**

```sql
-- Enhanced agent_profiles table
challenge_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0
challenge_starting_referrals INTEGER DEFAULT 0
challenge_max_referrals_reached INTEGER DEFAULT 0

-- Updated agent_tiers with new names
'rookie', 'bronze', 'iron', 'steel', 'silver', 'gold', 'platinum', 'diamond'

-- Diamond gets 300 days (not unlimited)
('diamond', 'Diamond Agent', 25000, 35.00, 4, 300, '...')
```

### **New Database Functions**

```sql
-- Progressive reset system functions
get_reset_starting_point(tier, attempt, max_reached)
get_challenge_duration(tier, attempt)
get_max_attempts(tier)
get_previous_tier(tier)
reset_agent_challenge(user_id)
complete_agent_challenge(user_id)
```

### **TypeScript Updates**

```typescript
// Updated AgentTier interface
tierName: "rookie" |
  "bronze" |
  "iron" |
  "steel" |
  "silver" |
  "gold" |
  "platinum" |
  "diamond";

// Enhanced AgentProfile interface
challengeAttempts: number;
challengeStartingReferrals: number;
challengeMaxReferralsReached: number;
isFirstFourTiers: boolean;
maxAttemptsAllowed: number;
resetStartingPoint: number;
```

### **Utility Functions**

```typescript
// Progressive reset system utilities
usesProgressiveResetSystem(tierName);
getMaxAttemptsForTier(tierName);
calculateResetStartingPoint(tier, attempt, requirement, maxReached);
getChallengeDuration(tier, attempt);
getPreviousTier(tier);
```
