# 🔧 ADMIN DASHBOARD FIX - Enhanced Features Now Visible

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED!**

### **The Problem:**

You weren't seeing the enhanced social media features because the admin dashboard was defaulting to the "Transactions" tab instead of the "Agent Applications" tab where all the enhancements are located.

### **The Solution:**

✅ **Changed default tab from 'transactions' to 'agents'**

**Before:**

```javascript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState("transactions"); // Default: Transactions
```

**After:**

```javascript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState("agents"); // Default: Agent Applications
```
