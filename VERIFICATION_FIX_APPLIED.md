# Email Verification Fix Applied ✅

## Problem Fixed
The verification email was pointing to a broken Supabase Edge Function URL that caused "This site can't be reached" errors.

## Solution Applied
Updated the `emailRedirectTo` in AuthContext registration to point to your local app:
```typescript
emailRedirectTo: `http://localhost:5178/verify-email`
```

## What Changed
- ✅ Fixed redirect URL to point to local application
- ✅ Simplified email verification to use Supabase native system
- ✅ Removed dependency on broken custom email service
- ✅ Verification page already exists and configured

## Test Now
1. Visit http://localhost:5178
2. Register a new account
3. Check the verification email
4. The link should now point to your local app instead of broken Supabase function

The verification email should now contain a working link to `http://localhost:5178/verify-email` instead of the broken edge function URL!
