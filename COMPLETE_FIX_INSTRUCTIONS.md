🔥 COMPLETE REGISTRATION FIX - STEP BY STEP

## WHAT THIS DOES

- ✅ Creates a DATABASE TRIGGER that automatically creates user profiles
- ✅ Fixes ALL RLS policy issues
- ✅ Eliminates the need for manual user creation in code
- ✅ Works with standard Supabase auth.signUp()

## STEP 1: Apply Complete Database Fix

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: bmtaqilpuszwoshtizmq
3. Click "SQL Editor"
4. Copy ALL the SQL from `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION_FIX.sql`
5. Paste and RUN it
6. Look for: `✅ Complete registration system fixed with auto-trigger!`

## STEP 2: Test Registration Flow

1. Go to your registration page: http://localhost:5173/register
2. Fill out the form with test data:
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
   - Username: testuser123
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Country: United States
   - Phone: 1234567890
   - Password: password123
3. Click "Register & Deposit"

## STEP 3: Check Console Messages

You should see:

```
🎯 AuthContext register function called!
📝 Starting REAL Supabase registration for: test@example.com
🔄 Creating user with Supabase auth...
✅ User created in Supabase auth: [user-id]
💾 User profile will be created automatically via database triggers
🎉 Registration completed successfully!
```

## STEP 4: Verify in Database

1. Go to Supabase dashboard → Table Editor
2. Click on "users" table
3. Look for your test user - should be created automatically!

## HOW THE TRIGGER WORKS

1. User fills registration form
2. AuthContext calls `supabase.auth.signUp()`
3. Supabase creates user in `auth.users` table
4. **DATABASE TRIGGER automatically fires**
5. Trigger creates matching record in `public.users` table
6. User gets full profile with referral code, country, etc.

## IF ISSUES PERSIST

- Check browser console for 401 errors
- Verify trigger was created in database
- Test direct navigation to verify-code page
- Check Supabase logs for trigger execution

This approach is much more reliable than manual user creation! 🚀
