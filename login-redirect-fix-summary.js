// This creates a summary of the fix and what to expect

console.log('✅ LOGIN REDIRECT ISSUE FIXED!');
console.log('=============================');

console.log('\n🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:');
console.log('==================');

console.log(`
BEFORE (The Problem):
❌ Users who verified their emails would login successfully
❌ But they would stay on login page with just "Welcome back!" message
❌ No automatic redirect to payment page
❌ Users had to manually navigate or register again

AFTER (The Solution):
✅ Login function now returns user data immediately
✅ Login component uses returned user data for instant redirect
✅ No more timing issues with useEffect dependencies
✅ Clear redirect logic based on user status
✅ Verified users automatically go to payment page
`);

console.log('\n🎯 REDIRECT LOGIC NOW:');
console.log('=====================');

console.log(`
1. USER LOGS IN SUCCESSFULLY
   ↓
2. LOGIN FUNCTION RETURNS USER DATA IMMEDIATELY
   ↓
3. LOGIN COMPONENT CHECKS USER STATUS:
   
   IF Test Account (thearnest7@gmail.com, etc.)
   → Redirect to Dashboard ✅
   
   IF Not Verified
   → Redirect to Email Verification ✅
   
   IF Verified BUT Not Paid
   → Redirect to Payment Page ✅
   
   IF Verified AND Paid
   → Redirect to Dashboard ✅
`);

console.log('\n🧪 TEST SCENARIOS:');
console.log('==================');

console.log(`
SCENARIO 1: Existing Verified User Logs In
- User: nonelliejay@gmail.com (from Supabase dashboard)
- Expected: Login → Check Status → Redirect to Payment Page ✅

SCENARIO 2: Test Account Logs In  
- User: thearnest7@gmail.com
- Expected: Login → Bypass to Dashboard ✅

SCENARIO 3: Unverified User Logs In
- Expected: Login → Redirect to Email Verification ✅

SCENARIO 4: Paid User Logs In
- Expected: Login → Redirect to Dashboard ✅
`);

console.log('\n💻 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:');
console.log('========================');

console.log(`
1. START THE DEV SERVER:
   npm run dev

2. NAVIGATE TO LOGIN PAGE:
   http://localhost:5173/login

3. TRY LOGGING IN WITH:
   Email: nonelliejay@gmail.com
   Password: EarnPro2025!

4. OBSERVE CONSOLE LOGS:
   🔐 Login attempt for: nonelliejay@gmail.com
   ✅ Login successful! Handling immediate redirect...
   👤 Logged in user data: {...}
   🔍 User status check: { isVerified: true, isPaidUser: false }
   💳 User verified but not paid - redirecting to PAYMENT page

5. VERIFY REDIRECT:
   Should automatically go to /payment page with state data

6. CHECK PAYMENT PAGE:
   Should show activation fee and payment options
`);

console.log('\n🔍 DEBUGGING NOTES:');
console.log('==================');
