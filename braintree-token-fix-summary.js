// BRAINTREE CLIENT TOKEN ISSUE - SOLUTION SUMMARY
console.log('🎯 BRAINTREE CLIENT TOKEN ISSUE - SOLUTION SUMMARY');
console.log('=================================================');

console.log(`
✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
========================
Error: CLIENT_AUTHORIZATION_INVALID
- The Braintree client tokens are expired or invalid
- Your Drop-in form is actually WORKING (I saw it in the screenshot!)
- The SDK is loaded correctly
- The container exists and displays properly

🔧 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
=======================
1. Created WorkingBraintreeHandler.ts - focuses on fresh token generation
2. Updated PaymentHandler.ts - now uses working version with fresh tokens
3. Enhanced Edge Function integration - ensures fresh tokens from your Braintree API

📋 YOUR EDGE FUNCTION STATUS:
============================
✅ Properly configured at: supabase/functions/braintree-client-token/index.ts
✅ Has real Braintree credentials (not dummy values)
✅ Generates fresh tokens via Braintree API
✅ Handles customer_id properly for one-time payments

🎯 WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW:
=========================
When you try Braintree payment:
1. Working handler requests fresh token from your Edge Function
2. Edge Function calls Braintree API with your real credentials
3. Fresh, valid client token is returned
4. Drop-in is created with the fresh token
5. Payment form appears (like in your screenshot)
6. No more CLIENT_AUTHORIZATION_INVALID errors

🧪 TEST STEPS:
=============
1. Refresh your browser page: http://localhost:5174/payment
2. Select Braintree payment option
3. Look for these console messages:
   🔧 WORKING BRAINTREE PAYMENT HANDLER
   🔑 Getting fresh client token from Edge Function...
   ✅ Got fresh client token: [token starts here]...
   🔧 Creating Drop-in with fresh token...
   ✅ SUCCESS! Working Drop-in created with fresh token

🔍 IF IT STILL FAILS:
====================
Check these in browser console:

1. Network tab - look for successful call to:
   /functions/v1/braintree-client-token

2. Edge Function response should contain:
   {success: true, clientToken: "actual_token_here"}

3. If Edge Function fails, check Supabase logs for:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Braintree API connection issues
   - Credential validation errors

💡 KEY INSIGHT:
==============
Your Braintree integration was 99% correct!
The only issue was using hardcoded/expired tokens instead of fresh ones from your Edge Function.

The working solution focuses on:
✅ Fresh token generation every time
✅ Proper error handling for token failures
✅ Direct integration with your existing Edge Function
✅ Simplified approach without complex fallbacks

🚀 READY TO TEST THE WORKING SOLUTION!
