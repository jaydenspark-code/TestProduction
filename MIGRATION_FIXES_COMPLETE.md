# ðŸŽ‰ MIGRATION ISSUES FIXED - SUMMARY REPORT

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Community Features Migration Conflicts**

**Problem:** The migration was trying to create a `user_achievements` table that already existed with a different structure.

**Solution:**

- Created a fixed migration that checks for existing tables and columns
- Added proper constraint handling for existing data
- Used `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `ALTER TABLE` statements with existence checks
- Fixed UUID duplicate removal using `ROW_NUMBER()` instead of `MIN()`

### 2. **Advertising Platform Migration Conflicts**

**Problem:** The migration was trying to create advertising tables that were already created manually.

**Solution:**

- Created a fixed migration that handles existing tables gracefully
- Removed problematic unique constraints with expressions (PostgreSQL doesn't support them)
- Added proper index and policy creation with existence checks
- Fixed enum type creation to avoid conflicts

### 3. **Policy Creation Errors**

**Problem:** Migrations were trying to drop policies that didn't exist, causing errors.

**Solution:**

- Used `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` with exception handling
- Implemented proper error handling in DO blocks
- Ensured policies are created only after safe removal
