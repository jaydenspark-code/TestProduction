## System Architecture

### Database Schema

- is_active: BOOLEAN
- created_at, updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

#### 2. `agent_applications`

Main application data with AI and admin review information.

```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- user_id: UUID (Foreign Key ‚Üí auth.users)
- application_data: JSONB (Personal info, motivation)
- social_media_profiles: JSONB (Platform data with follower counts)
- ai_score: DECIMAL(5,2) (0-100 compliance score)
- ai_decision: VARCHAR(20) ['approved', 'rejected', 'flagged', 'pending']
- ai_decision_reason: TEXT
- ai_compliance_details: JSONB (Detailed platform analysis)
- admin_status: VARCHAR(20) ['approved', 'rejected', 'pending']
- admin_reviewed_by: UUID (Foreign Key ‚Üí auth.users)
- admin_review_reason: TEXT
- final_status: VARCHAR(20) ['approved', 'rejected', 'pending']
- is_reapplication: BOOLEAN
- previous_application_id: UUID
- submitted_at, processed_at, created_at, updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

#### 3. `application_review_history`

Complete audit trail of all review decisions.

```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- application_id: UUID (Foreign Key ‚Üí agent_applications)
- reviewer_type: VARCHAR(10) ['ai', 'admin']
- reviewer_id: UUID (NULL for AI, user_id for admin)
- action: VARCHAR(20) ['approved', 'rejected', 'flagged']
- reason: TEXT
- review_data: JSONB (Additional metadata)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
```

#### 4. `application_reports`

Daily analytics and reporting data.

```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- report_date: DATE
- total_applications: INTEGER
- ai_approved, ai_rejected, ai_flagged: INTEGER
- admin_approved, admin_rejected: INTEGER
- admin_overrides: INTEGER (Admin decisions differing from AI)
- average_ai_score: DECIMAL(5,2)
- platform_stats: JSONB (Platform-specific statistics)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### Core Functions

#### 1. `process_ai_application_review(application_id)`

Main AI review function that:

- Analyzes each social media platform
- Calculates compliance scores
- Determines approval/rejection/flagging
- Updates application status
- Creates review history entry

#### 2. `process_admin_application_review(application_id, admin_id, decision, reason)`

Admin review function that:

- Records admin decision and reasoning
- Updates final application status
- Activates user as agent if approved
- Creates review history entry

#### 3. `generate_daily_application_report(date)`

Analytics function that:

- Calculates daily statistics
- Generates platform-specific metrics
- Creates comprehensive reporting data

## AI Decision Logic

### Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
For each platform:
  if followers >= required: score = 100
  else if followers >= (required * 0.8): score = 60
  else: score = 0

final_score = (total_score / max_possible_score) * 100
```

### Decision Matrix

- **Score ‚â•90% AND all platforms compliant** ‚Üí Auto-Approve
- **Score ‚â•60% AND some platforms close** ‚Üí Flag for Admin Review
- **Score <60%** ‚Üí Auto-Reject

### Flagging Criteria

Applications are flagged when:

- Overall score is 60-89%
- One or more platforms are 80-99% of requirements
- Quality indicators suggest potential approval
