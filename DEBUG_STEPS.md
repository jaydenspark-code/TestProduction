🔧 REGISTRATION DEBUG STEPS

PROBLEM: Registration failing due to multiple issues:

1. ❌ Database RLS policies blocking user creation
2. ❌ Email API not working (causing 404 errors)
3. ❌ Page routing issue (URL changes but component doesn't update)

SOLUTION STEPS:

STEP 1: Fix Database (MOST CRITICAL)

- Apply the SQL fix in URGENT_DATABASE_FIX.md
- This is blocking ALL user creation

STEP 2: Test Registration Flow
After database fix, test with these console commands:

// Open browser console on registration page
// Fill out form and watch for these console messages:

✅ GOOD: "🎯 handleSubmit called!"
✅ GOOD: "📝 Starting REAL Supabase registration"
✅ GOOD: "✅ User created in Supabase auth"
❌ BAD: "❌ Supabase auth signup error"

STEP 3: Check Database

- Go to Supabase dashboard → Table Editor → users table
- Look for your test user entry
- If user exists = registration worked, email is the only issue

STEP 4: Route Testing

- Try direct URL: localhost:5173/verify-code?email=test@test.com
- Should show verification page, not registration page

CURRENT STATUS: Need database fix first, then can debug other issues.
